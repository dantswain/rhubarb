What is rhubarb?
------------------
rhubarb is a lightweight and extensible inter-process communication (IPC) server.  rhubarb is a base class, written in ruby, with the intention that you add your own functionality by subclassing it.

Communication with rhubarb is via lines of text and therefore clients can be written in any language with socket support.
